# EfCore.GenericEventRunner

This library allows users of Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to add events to their entity classes, i.e. the classes that EF Core maps to a database. It is useful if you have business rules that are tiggered by a property changing, or an event such as receiving an customer order and you need to check some things before you can accept it.
